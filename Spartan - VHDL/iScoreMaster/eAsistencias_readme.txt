   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

eAsistencias_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

eAsistencias_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
